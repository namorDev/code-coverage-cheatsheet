== About Code Coverage
Code coverage is a percentage measure of the degree to which the source code of a program is executed when a particular test suite is run

== Types of Coverage

Disclaimer: Sometimes the names for coverage types differ! This is also true for namings such as C0, C1 etc.
Depending on how something is programmed, the number of testcases can vary. E.g. if-statements with logical operators or nested if-statements

.Table Coverage Types
|===
| Type | German Term | Mathematical description | Description

|Function coverage
|
|
|Has each function in the program been called?

|Line Coverage / Statement coverage
|Anweisungsüberdeckung
|stem:[C_0 = ("Number of covered lines") / ("Total number of lines")]
|Has each statement in the program been executed?

|Edge Coverage
|
|
|Has every edge in the control-flow graph been executed?

|Branch Coverage / Decision Coverage
|Entscheidungsüberdeckung
|stem:[C_1 = ("Number of covered branches") / ("Total number of branches")]
|Is a subset of Edge Coverage. Given an if-statement, have both the true and false path been executed?

|Condition Coverage
|Bedingungstest
|
|Has each Boolean sub-expression evaluated both to true and false? (Also called predicate coverage2)

|Multiple Condition Coverage (MCC)
|Mehrfachbedingungstest
|
|The combination of the conditions is relevant

|Modified condition/decision Coverage (MCDC)
|Modifizierter Bedingungs-/Entscheidungstest
|
|Combination of function coverage and branch coverage. Sometimes also called Decision Coverage
