== About Code Coverage
Code coverage is a percentage measure of the degree to which the source code of a program is executed when a particular test suite is run

== Types of Coverage
.Table Coverage Types
|===
| Type | Mathematical description | Description

|Function coverage
|
|Has each function in the program been called?

|Line Coverage / Statement coverage
|stem:[C_0 = ("Number of covered lines") / ("Total number of lines")]
|Has each statement in the program been executed?

|Edge Coverage
|
|Has every edge in the control-flow graph been executed?

|Branch Coverage / Decision Coverage
|stem:[C_0 = ("Number of covered branches") / ("Total number of branches")]
|Is a subset of Edge Coverage. Given an if-statement, have both the true and false path been executed?

|Condition Coverage
|
|Has each Boolean sub-expression evaluated both to true and false? (Also called predicate coverage2)

|Modified condition/decision Coverage (MCDC)
|
|Combination of function coverage and branch coverage. Sometimes also called Decision Coverage
